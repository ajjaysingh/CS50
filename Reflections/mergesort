Merge sort sorts by dividing the array until we are left with just single elements then sorting them while merging.
If we divide 'n' element array into half every time then no of times it will be divided will be ---- log(n)
Each time we split the list, we had to merge n elements together(we need to move n elements)    ---- n

therefore the time complexity of merge sort is o(nlogn).
